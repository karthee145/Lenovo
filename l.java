jab tak tujhe pyaar se
beinteha main bhar na doon
jab tak main duaaoon sa
sau dafa tujhe paDh na loon

until I fill you completely with love
until I read you a hundred times like prayers,

haan mere paas tum raho
jaane ki baat na karo
mere saath tum raho
jaane ki baat na karo

stay close to me,
don't talk about leaving.
stay with me,
don't talk about leaving.

tum aa gaye baazuon mein mere
sau savere liye
sau savere liye

you have come in my arms,
taking a hundred mornings.

haan baadalon se utaara gaya
tumko mere liye
sirf mere liye

you have been brought down from the clouds,
for me, just for me.

jab tak meri ungliyaan
tere baalon se kuch keh na lein
jab tak teri lehar mein
khwahishein meri beh na lein

until my fingers say something
to your hair.
until my wishes flow a bit
in your waves.

haan mere paas tum raho
jaane ki baat na karo
mere saath tum raho
jaane ki baat na karo

wo...
